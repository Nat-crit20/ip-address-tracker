## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Leaflet API
- IP Geolocation API

### What I learned

For this I learned how to use the leaflet API and the IP geolocation API; as well as reinforced my knowledge of async functions. I also learned how to take incoming calls from one API and use that to call the next API. I also only used a little bootstrap for the search bar.

### Continued development

I hope to find a way to add abbreviations to the time zones. As well as to find ways in which more errors can occur and find ways to solve them
