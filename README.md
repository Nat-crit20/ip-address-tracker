## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Leaflet API
- IP Geolocation API

### What I learned

For this I learned how to use the leaflet api and the ip geoloctaion api; as well as reinforce my knownledge in asyc functions. I also learned how to take the incoming calls from one api and used that to call the next api. I also only used a little bootstrap for the search bar.

### Continued development

I hope to find a way to add abbrivations to the timezones. As well as to find way in which more errors can occur and find was to solve them
